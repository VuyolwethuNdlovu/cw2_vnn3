            Climate change and global warming affect all regions around the world, and the Valley of Shangri-La is not an exception. Shangri-La City Council has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2 and N2O from transport. It plans to introduce SLEZ (Shangri-L Low Emission Zone) to the city by the end of 2022 and install more electric vehicle charging stations.

            The Shangri-La City Council has decided to open public consultation on its plans to implement SLEZ, and the residents are being asked to offer their opinions on the detail and the proposed boundaries of SLEZ.
